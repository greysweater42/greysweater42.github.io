      <description>1. What is reshape2 and why would you use it? reshape2 is an R package that lets you change the shape of any dataframe, i.e. to pivot and to “unpivot”.
Keep in mind that if your favourite R package for dataframes manipulation is data.table, functions dcast and melt are already in this package and work exactly the same as those in reshape2.
 2. A few simple examples In fact there are only two functions worth mentioning: dcast, which is equivalent to MS Excel pivot table, and melt, which does the opposite or unpivots a table.</description>
