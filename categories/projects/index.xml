      <description>1. Can you tell the difference between these two cars?    Me neither, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if a convolutional neural network can.
2. What am I doing? I am practicing my CNN skills on a subject that is particularly close to my heart: a legendary vehicle Fiat 126p in which I was travelling around Poland with my family in the 1990s. To me this was the best car in the world and it left many cars behind in various categories, mainly styling and&amp;hellip; well, styling.</description>

      <description>1. Intro 1. Why I’m making this project There are two main reasons for this project:
 I’ve recently deep dived into pytorch and I want to test in on a real task. I’ve been using pytorch extensively at work, but I usually didn’t have enough time to study its quirks as thouroughly as I wanted.
 As I was studying Quantitative Methods in Economy, my all-time dream was to predict fluctuations on the stock market, i.</description>

      <description>1. Why writing a cookbook/blog? In 2016, when I decided to become a data scientist, I was overwhelmed by the number of skills I had to possess to start this sort of career. Reading job offers convinced me that I should be a specialist in:
  statistics and mathematics (which I learned at the univerity),
  machine learning and data mining (which are fairly easy to learn by yourself if you have a statistical background),</description>

      <description>This project is not finished and will be developed over time.
 0. Why I’m making this project  I want to try out new programming and statistical tools that I read or heard about (tidytext, nlp, laser) on a subject that I find interesting (text editors).
 If somebody asks me if vim is a good choice for a text editor, I want to have objective arguments to prove my statement.</description>
