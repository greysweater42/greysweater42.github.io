## 1. What is sqldf and why would you use it?

`sqldf` package lets you treat any `data.frame` object as an sql table, which means that you can write queries just as if you were using an sql database. Since the emergence of libraries such as data.table or dplyr + tidyverse, `sqldf` turns out to be fairly useless, so now it is rather a curiosity than a game-changer.

Despite its uselessness, it works like a charm.


## 2. A few simple examples:

Semicolon at the end of each query is not obligatory.

Load the package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sqldf)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sqldf))
```

Selecting specific columns (known as "projection operator"):
```{r}
# mtcars is a pre-defined data frame and is already available in the global environment
sqldf('select mpg, cyl, disp from mtcars where cyl = 6')
```

A simple where clause (known as "selection operator"):
```{r}
sqldf('select * from mtcars where mpg > 21')
```

Group by and order by:
```{r}
sqldf('select cyl, count(*) number from mtcars group by cyl order by cyl')
```

Joining:
```{r}
customers <- data.frame(
  id_customers = c(1, 2, 3),
  name = c("Zidane", "Figo", "Beckham")
)
orders <- data.frame(
  id_orders = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  id_customers = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 1),
  products = c("fotball", "shoes", "t-shirt", "shoes", "energy drink")
)

sqldf("select * from customers c join orders o on c.id_customers = o.id_customers")
```

Subqueries:
```{r}
sqldf('select a.mpg from (select mpg, cyl, disp from mtcars where cyl = 6) as a')
```

As you can see, all of the most common sql operations are available in `sqldf`.
